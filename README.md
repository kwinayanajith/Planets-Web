# Theme Switcher Project

This project is a simple web page that demonstrates a light and dark theme switcher.

## Features

-   **Theme Toggle Button:** Allows users to switch between a light theme and a dark theme.
-   **Persistent Preference:** The chosen theme is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists across sessions.

## Files

-   `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the page. Contains the toggle button and sample content.
-   `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for both light and dark themes.
-   `script.js`: Implements the JavaScript logic for theme switching and saving the preference to local storage.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2.  Click the "Switch to Dark Theme" / "Switch to Light Theme" button to toggle between the themes.
3.  The theme choice will be remembered the next time you open the page in the same browser.
